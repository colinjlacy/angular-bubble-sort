#Angular Bubble Sort#

This is a quick Bubble Sort demo in the style of your standard CS 101 assignment, using AngularJS and PHP (and Bootstrap & LESS).  Feel free to take a look.

##Why?##

Not too long ago it came up in conversation that this is a common assignment in Computer Science programs.  So when it came time for me to whip one up, I thought I'd use some of the skills I've been working on to give it a modern touch.  

###Interested?###

Files are all ready to go if you want to see it in action.  Just be sure to run it on a machine that has PHP 5.3 running.  You can also see a demo [on my website](https://webcake.co/demos/angular-bubble-sort "Angular Bubble Sort").
